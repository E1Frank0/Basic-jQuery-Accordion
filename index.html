    <p>Caesar's Comet (C/-43 K1) is also known as 'Comet Caesar' and the 'Great Comet of 44 BC'.</p>
    <p>It was one of the most famous comets of antiquity.</p>

    <p>Comet Borrelly is a periodic comet. Periodic comets can only be seen from earth once every few years or decades.</p>
    <p>It was visited by the spacecraft Deep Space 1. Comet Borrelly was last seen from earth in September 2001 and will likely be seen again in July 2008.</p>

    <div id="comet-3" class="accordion-box-content">
        
    <p>Comet Encke or Encke's Comet (official designation: 2P/Encke) is a periodic comet that completes an orbit of the Sun once every 3.3 years.</p>
    <p>Encke was first recorded by Pierre Méchain in 1786, but it was not recognized as a periodic comet until 1819 when its orbit was computed by Johann Franz Encke.</p>

    <p>Comet Hale–Bopp (formerly called C/1995 O1) is the biggest and brightest comet that has come by Earth in the last century.</p>
    <p>It was called the Great Comet of 1997. It is probably the most-seen comet in history - even more than the famous Halley's comet.</p>

    <p>Halley's Comet (Comet Halley) is a comet which comes round every 75 or 76 years.</p>
    <p>When it is near, it can be seen with the naked eye. It will return in 2061.</p>

    <p>Comet Humason, formally designated C/1961 R1 (a.k.a. 1962 VIII and 1961e), was a non-periodic comet discovered by Milton L. Humason on September 1, 1961.</p>
    <p>Its perihelion was well beyond the orbit of Mars, at 2.133 AU. Its period is 2940 years, and the diameter of its nucleus estimated at about 41 km.</p>

    <p>Comet Hyakutake (Japanese pronunciation: [çʲakɯ̥take], formally designated C/1996 B2) is a comet, discovered on 31 January 1996,[1] that passed very close to Earth in March of that year.</p>
    <p>It was dubbed The Great Comet of 1996; its passage near the Earth was one of the closest cometary approaches of the previous 200 years. Hyakutake appeared very bright in the night sky and was widely seen around the world.</p>

    <p>Comet Ikeya–Seki, formally designated C/1965 S1, 1965 VIII, and 1965f, was a long-period comet discovered independently by Kaoru Ikeya and Tsutomu Seki.</p>
    <p>First observed as a faint telescopic object on September 18, 1965, the first calculations of its orbit suggested that on October 21, it would pass just 450,000 km above the Sun's surface, and would probably become extremely bright.</p>

    <p>Comet Kohoutek, formally designated C/1973 E1, 1973 XII, and 1973f, was first sighted on 7 March 1973 by Czech astronomer Luboš Kohoutek. It attained perihelion on 28 December that same year.</p>
    <p>Comet Kohoutek is a long-period comet; its previous apparition was about 150,000 years ago, and its next apparition will be in about 75,000 years.</p>

    <p>The following is a list of parabolic and hyperbolic comets in the Solar System. Many of these comets may come from the Oort cloud, or perhaps even have interstellar origin.</p>
    <p>The Oort Cloud is not gravitationally attracted enough to the Sun to form into a fairly thin disk, like the inner Solar System.</p>

    <a class="accordion-box-title" href="#comet-11">Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9</a>
    <div id="comet-11" class="accordion-box-content">
        
    <p>Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 (formally designated D/1993 F2) was a comet that broke apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects.</p>
    <p>This generated a large amount of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space debris in the inner Solar System.</p>

    <p>Comet Skjellerup–Maristany, formally designated C/1927 X1, 1927 IX, and 1927k, was a long-period comet which became very bright in 1927.</p>
    <p>This great comet was observable to the naked eye for about 32 days. It was independently discovered by amateur astronomers John Francis Skjellerup in Australia on November 28, 1927 and Edmundo Maristany in Argentina on December 6, 1927, and noted for its strong yellow appearance, caused by emission from sodium atoms.</p>

    <p>Comet West, formally designated C/1975 V1, 1976 VI, and 1975n, was a comet which became one of the brightest objects in the night sky as it passed through the inner solar system in 1976.</p>
    <p>During perihelion the comet had a minimum solar elongation of 6.4° and as a result of forward scattering reached a peak apparent magnitude of -3.[3] From February 25 through the 27th, observers reported that the comet was bright enough to study during full daylight.</p>

    <a class="accordion-box-title" href="#comet-14">Great Comet of 1807</a>
    <div id="comet-14" class="accordion-box-content">
    
    <p>C/1807 R1 (also known as the Great Comet of 1807) is a long-period comet, which in 1807 was visible to naked-eye observers in the northern hemisphere from early September to late December.</p>
    <p>Orbital data points compiled in the northern hemisphere indicate a surprising fact. This comet should have been first discovered by the unassisted eye in the southern hemisphere several weeks before its actual discovery in the northern hemisphere.</p>

    <a class="accordion-box-title" href="#comet-15">Great Comet of 1811</a>
    <div id="comet-15" class="accordion-box-content">
        
    <p>The Great Comet of 1811,[1] formally designated C/1811 F1, is a comet that was visible to the naked eye for around 260 days, a record it held until the appearance of Comet Hale–Bopp in 1997.</p>
    <p>The comet was discovered March 25, 1811 by Honoré Flaugergues at 2.7 AU from the Sun in the now-defunct constellation of Argo Navis.</p>

    <a class="accordion-box-title" href="#comet-16">Great March Comet of 1843</a>
    <div id="comet-16" class="accordion-box-content">
        
    <p>The Great Comet of 1843, formally designated C/1843 D1 and 1843 I, was a long-period comet which became very bright in March 1843 (it is also known as the Great March Comet). It was discovered on February 5, 1843 and rapidly brightened to become a great comet.</p>
    <p>First observed in early February, 1843, it raced toward an incredibly close perihelion of less than 830,000 km on February 27, 1843; at this time it was observed in broad daylight roughly a degree away from the Sun.[2] It passed closest to Earth on March 6, 1843, and was at its greatest brilliance the following day; unfortunately for observers north of the equator, at its peak it was best visible from the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

    <a class="accordion-box-title" href="#comet-17">Great January Comet</a>
    <div id="comet-17" class="accordion-box-content">
        
    <p>The Great January Comet of 1910, formally designated C/1910 A1 and often referred to as the Daylight Comet,[2] was a comet which appeared in January 1910. It was already visible to the naked eye when it was first noticed, and many people independently "discovered" the comet.</p>
    <p>The comet brightened rather suddenly, and was initially visible from the southern hemisphere only. A number of individuals claimed "discovery", but the comet is thought to have been first spotted by diamond miners in the Transvaal before dawn on January 12, 1910, by which time it was already a prominent naked-eye object of apparent magnitude −1.</p>

    <a class="accordion-box-title" href="#comet-18">Comet Swift–Tuttle</a>
    <div id="comet-18" class="accordion-box-content">
        
    <p>Comet Swift–Tuttle (formally designated 109P/Swift–Tuttle) is a periodic comet with a current (osculating) orbital period of 133 years. It fits the classical definition of a Halley-type comet with a period between 20 and 200 years.</p>
    <p>The comet is on an orbit that makes repeated close approaches to the Earth-Moon system,[5] and has an Earth-MOID (Minimum orbit intersection distance) of 0.0009 AU (130,000 km; 84,000 mi).[1] Upon its 1992 rediscovery, the comet's date of perihelion passage was off from the then-current prediction by 17 days.</p>
